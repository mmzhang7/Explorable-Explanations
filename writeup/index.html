    <h1>Initial Prototype Writeup</h1>
    <p> For the initial prototype, our group succesfully created an interactive map visualization
        that allows users to explore hurricane data, specifically focusing on Hurricane Ida (2021).
        The main features of our prototype include: clicking on the hurricane location to launch 
        the hurricane viewer and using the slider to scroll through the visualization depending on the time. 
        We also implemented an option where the hurricane viewer automatically plays through the transitions between each of the timestamps. 
        We are currently in the process of adding the other hurricanes as well as the hurricane simulation game.</p>
        </p>
    <p> The hardest part to design and implement will probably be the hurricane game. Our first consideration is how much detail and layers we want to incorporate, since we will need to balance browser computing power with detail and accuracy. We also need to ensure that our project fulfils the explorable explanation "storytelling"
    element of the project description. Our plan is to add annotations and text to both the simulated game, which will be quite varying 
depending on the selections and customizations that the viewer makes. This is true especially considering just the hurricane timeseries by timestamp already takes quite a bit of time to initiate.</p>
